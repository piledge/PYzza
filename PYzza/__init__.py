Copyright 2023 [piledge]. Licensed under the MIT license.

PYzza is a small collection of Python-Functions created by a Pizza-enthusiast and with no specific topic.

This package is a result of me constantly breaking the DRY principle by copy-and-pasting stuff from old projects into new ones and to have a centralized database to access the functions from several computing instances.

The PYzza-package does not solve any large problem, but it can help to save time by eliminating repetitive code and provide easy access to some more complicated interfaces of different packages.

This package is constantly being expanded and improved. Any ideas for new functions or bug reports will be appreciated.
